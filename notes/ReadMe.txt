This, The Master Branch Does NOT Contain The [Most Latest] Code.
There is though a folder named Backup. It may not contain the latest version, though.

The notes Folder is for this file itself and a Todo List.

If you want to find the latest code, switch the branch to 'gh-pages'.
If you want to Try out upaint, go to http://pat457.github.io/upaint
